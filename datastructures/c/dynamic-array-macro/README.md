# dynamic-array-macro
This is an implementation of a Dynamic Array in C. It is *entirely* macro based, so all you need to do is put the
header file into your project, and get started. A side effect of it being completely macro based is that allows for
you to write completely type-safe Dynamic Arrays that hold *any* type you want (however, they cannot be mixed datatypes).
</br>
It is inspired by the ``vec`` implementation by ``rxi``.
